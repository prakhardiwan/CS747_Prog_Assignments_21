SEED VALUES were kept 0 as were provided in the code structure provided. Do not change those values. 

For running Task 1 run the following commands: 
1. python mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 1  
# This is the command for training. It generates the weights (T1.npy) and T1.jpg.
2. python mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 0  
# This command is for testing. It prints the average reward of 100 tests at the output terminal. 

For running Task 2 run the following commands: 
1. python mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 1  
# This is the command for training. It generates the weights (T2.npy) and T2.jpg.
2. python mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 0  
# This command is for testing. It prints the average reward of 100 tests at the output terminal. 


** Training of Task 2 takes more time for finishing compared to Task 1
