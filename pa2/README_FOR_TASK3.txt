1. python task3.py
Kindly see comments and then run accordingly to obtain player 1 policies
2. python analysis_task3.py 
Kindly see comments and then run accordingly to obtain player 1 policies
3. python analysis_task3.py

## The above commands were for the case when player 2 policy was pi[0] i.e. the input policy file was of player 2. For analysis of player1 following pi_0, minor edits can be done for analysis purpose, even though I have analysed all 4 policies provided in report
